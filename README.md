## My process

I started out with thinking about the html structure, then I created a git repo, fired up vs code and started coding. After finishing with the html I quickly styled the html with some css, applying the required font, colors and other details. Also, I used css variables for the first time to make my code better. After finishing the card I got to coding the hover effects, and here is where I encountered some difficulties. I had already known how to use pseudo-selectors, including `:hover`, but I had some trouble making the effect for the nft image. After a few hours of debuging and research, I managed to make it work.

Well, that was about it. It was harder then I expected but instead now I really know how to make hover effects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS

### What I learned

I learned:

- How to make hover effects, not only on text, but on images too
- How to apply transparent background colors using `rgba()` colors
- How to use css variables

### Continued development

I will continue making projects on Frontend Mentor and learning how to code on the frontend.
